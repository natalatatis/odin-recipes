    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The best guatemalan tamales out there.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs of corn masa</li>
        <li>1 lb of pork meat</li>
        <li>10 dried guajillo chilies</li>
        <li>5 dried ancho chilies</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Banana leaves or corn husks for wrapping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the dried chilies in hot water for about 20 minutes until they soften. Remove seeds and stems.</li>
        <li>In a blender, combine the soaked chilies, onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, and salt. Blend until smooth to create the sauce.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, cook the pork meat until tender. Shred the meat and mix it with the chili sauce. Simmer for 15 minutes to let the flavors meld.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, prepare the corn masa by mixing it with water and a pinch of salt until it reaches a dough-like consistency.</li>
        <li>If using banana leaves, soften them by briefly heating over an open flame or boiling water. If using corn husks, soak them in warm water until pliable.</li>
        <li>To assemble the tamales, spread a thin layer of masa onto the center of a banana leaf or corn husk. Add a spoonful of the meat filling on top of the masa. Fold the sides of the leaf or husk over the filling and then fold the bottom up to secure it.</li>
        <li>Place the assembled tamales upright in a steamer basket. Steam for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the masa is firm and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove tamales from the steamer and let them cool slightly before unwrapping and serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
